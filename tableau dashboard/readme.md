# Analysis and Conclusion of the Worksheets 

## Analysis of Medical Conditions: 
- Shows the medical industry and its financial impact on patients and healthcare 
utilization, we can depict a lot of gaps and a well-developed structure of the healthcare industry. 
In the investigation of medical use, we disentangle the complex relationship that exists between medical issues, 
test findings, and the associated financial costs, shedding light on the larger financial effects on patients as 
well as the healthcare system. Out of all the medical conditions, Cancer has the highest billing amount of 43,493,081.
This underscores the substantial financial strain linked to the Management of Cancer. Following closely behind are 
Asthma, Hypertension, Diabetes, Obesity, and Arthritis, highlighting the economic issues that these illnesses present. 
Nuanced insights can be obtained by analyzing the relationship between test findings and billing amount. 
Higher billing amounts are linked to abnormal testing findings, particularly in cases of asthma, diabetes, and 
hypertension. This suggests that individuals with complex health profiles may require more intensive medical care 
treatments and resource utilization. Even though the case for Diabetes is not the highest as compared to other health 
issues, it nevertheless commands a significant billing amount of 42,295,568. The findings of the test results shed 
light on complexities in patient’s health. Specifically, data for asthma and hypertension show a mixture of normal, 
inconclusive, and abnormal, highlighting the need for tailored therapies based on individual patient’s profiles. 
Variability in the findings of asthma and hypertension showed the significance of accurate monitoring and customized 
treatment regimes. Since cancer is a varied condition, patients with unclear results require additional diagnostic 
evaluations. The complicated link between patient outcomes, healthcare utilization, and budgetary considerations is
highlighted by this scenario. It demands a rigorous assessment of how resources are allocated, and how cost-effective 
they are. This also emphasizes how focused policies are developed to improve patient care and the financial stability 
of the healthcare system.

## Admission and Discharge Trends: 
- Depicts the analysis of the examination of annual admission statistics over the previous six years in the
healthcare system. 2018 saw 303 admittances. 1973 admissions in 2019 suggest a notable rise, either brought by better 
access to healthcare services or changing healthcare requirements. 2020 had 2044 admissions which maintain the 
increasing trend for medical treatment. 2063 were admitted in 2021 keeping a constant pattern, including a regular
use of healthcare over time. 2022 had 2001 patients indicating a small decline that calls for additional research into 
possible causes for the decline. 1616 admissions were there in 2023 suggesting a change in the dynamics of healthcare.
The distribution of patient discharges throughout the week can be analyzed through discharge patterns on a weekday basis. 
1493 discharges were there on Saturday which becomes the highest day with the number of discharges.1458 patients were 
discharged on Thursday indicating a steady demand for weekday discharges. From Tuesday to Wednesday, there was a steady 
decline in the discharge count trend. A piece of greater knowledge can be obtained by examining the correlation between
the average duration of stay and room number. The average length of stay for Room Number 352 is 20.700 which is the 
highest stay suggesting that patients in this room may have complicated requirements or require specialist care. 
Rooms 430 and 216 have the lowest average stay of 19 days. In conclusion, a thorough examination of weekly discharge
patterns, room-specific stay durations, and patient admission trends offers a multidimensional perspective on healthcare
consumption. Healthcare administrators may increase overall system efficiency, optimize resource allocation, and improve
patient care with the help of these insightful insights. The study's results determine the variables affecting discharge 
trends, changes in admission, and the length of stays in different rooms.

## Insurance Provider Analysis:
- Suggests that Medicare Insurance Provider contributes $48,129,775 or 18.86% of the total billing amount.
The average billing amount is $25,002.5. United Health Care provider averages $25,002.5 of the amount. 
19.69% of $50,250,468 is the total amount billed. Twenty- four percent of the total amount of billing, or 52,125,859 
is contributed by Blue Cross (average billing amount: $25,652.5). Cigna contributes $52,340,172, or 20.512% of the 
entire billing amount. Aetna contributes 20.505% of the total billing amount, or $52,321,795. The financial landscape 
of healthcare services is significantly shaped by Medicare, United Health Care, Blue Cross, Cigna, and Aetna, each of
which has unique billing patterns and periodic fluctuations. Healthcare administrators, insurers, and regulators must 
comprehend these dynamics to maximize resource allocation and guarantee the system’s financial viability. 

## Doctor Performance:
- It examines the billing amounts linked to specific physicians and offers important information on the financial
contributions made by each medical professional in the healthcare system. The best physicians display a range of invoice 
amounts, highlighting the variation in their contribution to healthcare earnings. Michael Johnson, Christopher Davis,
and Jennifer Smith stand out as important financial pillars that demand more research into the number of patients they 
serve and the services they provide. The significant influence they have in the healthcare system plays a vital role
in the long-term financial viability. Administrators and decision-makers can learn a lot about the financial dynamics
through the study of doctor billing amounts. 

##  Medication Usage:
- This provides the count of medical conditions and prescriptions for five different medicines (Paracetamol, Aspirin,
Penicillin, Lipitor, and Ibuprofen) as well as the billing amount. The number of prescriptions for each type of medicine
in the following years is displaced; 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. The information on patients such as their 
Age, Gender, Billing Amount, and Prescribed Medications is given. The relationship between patient information and medicine 
bills is connected. The most often drug is Paracetamol, which is followed by Penicillin. When compared to other drugs, 
Lipitor has a comparatively lower prescription count. Medicine admissions generally rose between 2018 to 2022, then 
somewhat declined in 2023. The age range of patients is 20 to 80 years old, with the majority being in the 40-60 years
age group. Patients in their 40s are frequently prescribed Paracetamol, but Penicillin is more 61 uniformly distributed 
among all age groups. Patients in their 30s and 40s are more likely to be prescribed Ibuprofen. The conclusion makes
recommendations for more study or analysis based on the trends found in the data. It functions as an overview of the 
knowledge discovered during the data analysis procedure.

## Test Results:
- This one has three categories of test results: Abnormal, Inconclusive, and Normal. For every category, there is a different
count of test findings and accompanying billing amounts. The most expensive test results are those that are abnormal,
followed by inconclusive and normal. Analysis is done on the distribution of test results throughout several years. 
Inconclusive and Normal tests have increased significantly in 2019. Obesity, Cancer, Asthma, Arthritis, Diabetes, and 
Hypertension are the medical conditions specified in the above data. Test results are broken down by Age show trends. 
While Abnormal test results are spread over a range of ages, inconclusive results are more common in younger age groups. 
In the middle age groups, normal test findings are common. More investigation and analysis to gain insightful knowledge 
and point out perspective areas for additional study.

## Cost Analysis by Age Group: 
- The dataset contains personal data, primarily about age, and associated bill amounts. Information on the average billing 
amount for each age group and the year of admission is also available. Finding patterns, trends, and insights that can 
yield important information is the main aim of analyzing the data. Data cleaning and manipulation are also done at this
stage to get insights into the data related to age and finances. 

## Admission Type Impact:
- Here we have examine the fees linked to various forms of admission while taking the number of rooms into account. 
There are three types of Admissions: Urgent, Emergency, and Elective. There are 3242 room numbers in the category 
of Elective, 3367 in Emergency, and 3391 in Urgent. The overall billing amount for the Elective is $83,941,322. 
The emergency had $83,193,560 amount, and $88,033,187 had the highest billing amount. Based on the percentage of the
total billing was 34.500% for Urgent, 32,603% for Emergency, and 32,896% for the Elective type. The Urgent Admission 
accounts for the largest portion of the entire billing amount. The percentages of Emergency and Elective hospitalizations 
are comparable and have a similar effect on the total billing amount. These observations can help healthcare facilities 
plan strategically, allocate resources, and comprehend the finances related to admission. One can investigate the connection
between the number of rooms and the charges for each kind of entrance to improve the healthcare system. The financial
distribution across different types of admission is fundamentally understood by the research, which offers insights that 
can guide decision-making in the medical industry.


## Patients Readmitted:
- This pays attention to the readmitted patient’s analysis. The analysis sheds light on the distribution of medical disorders, suggesting a spectrum of health concerns among the population. A historical perspective on readmissions is given by the yearly distribution, where 2021 had the highest number of readmissions. Asthma and Cancer are common medical disorders that point to ongoing health problems. Analyzing age, gender, and yearly distributions in readmissions yield information. The finances of the people are also affected by readmitted admission into the hospitals due to their prolonged diseases which need further diagnoses or have a long-lasting effect on the body.


## Blood Group Analysis
- The research in this delves into blood types, presenting percentages and counts of unique individuals. Each blood type’s related billing amounts are investigated. The financial viewpoint broadens the analysis by illustrating the financial impact of various blood types on medical expenses. For instance, the billing amount for the AB+ blood group is 32,598,680. AB- has the highest number of patients with various medical conditions. The gender-related data is introduced in the latter section of the study and is connected to blood groups. The study from above depicts these data can influence public health policies and research orientations by directing the use of resources and implementing targeted interventions. Comprehending the correlation between healthcare expenses, and blood groups is imperative for efficient and long- lasting healthcare administration.


# CONCLUSION
- The study has covered a wide range of ground in this in-depth investigation of the financial impact of healthcare utilization on both patients and the overall medical system. The financial dynamics of healthcare utilization are complex and require a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between economic factors, systematic sustainability, and patient experiences as we negotiate the complex web of healthcare economics. The financial burden that comes with using healthcare services frequently serves as a trigger, impacting the quality of life of people. Patient-centric approaches target people’s overall well-being rather than just the financial expenses.
-  We have found trends, patterns, and discrepancies that are critical to comprehending the state of the economy while analyzing the quantitative components of healthcare usage. The complex relationship between healthcare services use patterns, demographic variables, and related costs highlights the necessity for focused interventions that consider the particular financial difficulties that various population groups confront. As we study further, we realize that it is essential to promote equitable healthcare outcomes rather than particular healthcare outcomes. The study broadens its focus to include the systematic effects of healthcare usage on the larger healthcare system. The financial dynamics clarified in our work add significant insights to the continuing discussion on the resilience and sustainability of healthcare systems, from resource allocation to policy issues. Healthcare systems must be adjusted to maintain financial viability as we face the difficulties presented by a constantly changing environment.
- One must develop resilient healthcare systems that address both individual financial pressures and difficulties requires a patient-centric and flexible strategy. It is essential to adapt to the changes to take advantage of new possibilities and problems. Empathy towards the patients is as much required as other evidence-based decision-making in the pursuit of the financial viability of the healthcare future. Regulations that encourage patient-centric,
cost-effective treatments are formulated mostly by policymakers.
- With the knowledge gained from the study, healthcare professionals can put plans into action that can help patients with their expenses and lessen the burden on the medical industry while maintaining the long-term viability of their practices. The path ahead in the medical sector is complex and full of obstacles. Hence, we need to focus on patient-centric care, evidence-based practices, and empathy-based studies.
