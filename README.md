# Healthcare Analysis using Python Code


* The code that is provided loads data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame and then does an extensive analysis of a healthcare dataset. It then moves on to data cleaning and investigation, revealing the contents of the DataFrame and pointing out any null values. Then, using a variety of visualisations, such as histograms, boxplots,scatterplots, and barplots, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is carried out to comprehend the distribution and correlations between various variables, including billing amounts, medical conditions, age, admission types, insurance providers, and room utilisation. Next, a financial impact analysis is performed, which includes total revenue calculation, identification of high-cost medical diseases and common insurance providers, and trend analysis of billing amounts. In statistical analysis, correlations are computed, linear regression is carried out to model  the factors impacting billing amounts, and regression coefficients are assessed. In order to assess the linear regression model's predictive ability, measurements such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE),  Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) are used. All things considered, this code thoroughly examines  and evaluates the healthcare dataset, offering insightful information about the variables influencing billing amounts in a healthcare setting.


* Prediction of Billing Amount:

Based on patient demographics or other variables, the code's built-in linear regression model can be used to forecast billing amounts. For instance, the model can forecast how much a patient will be charged for their healthcare services based on their age, gender, medical condition, type of admission, and other factors.
Effects of Variables on Billing Amounts

Analysis results can be used to forecast how many variables, including age, health, insurance company, and kind of admittance, affect the amount of bills. One may anticipate, for example, that patients with a given medical condition or those treated under a particular form of admission will pay more or less in bills.

* Forecasting Revenue:

Healthcare providers can more precisely predict their revenue by knowing the distribution of billing amounts, patterns in room utilisation, and the financial impact of various factors. Based on past data and patterns found in the dataset, projections on the total revenue from admissions or revenue contributions from various insurance carriers can be formed.
Recognising Expensive Medical Conditions:

Healthcare practitioners can estimate which medical conditions would likely result in greater billing amounts by using the analysis that identifies high-cost medical conditions and popular insurance carriers. Healthcare organisations can use this information for risk management, financial planning, and resource allocation.

* Analysis of Financial Impact:

It is possible to forecast how various circumstances may affect patients' and the healthcare system's finances. The study, for instance, reveals how insurance coverage influences patients' out-of-pocket costs and how various admission types affect the number of bills. This information enables healthcare providers to predict patients' financial burden and modify their policies or services accordingly.


### All things considered, the research offers insightful information that can guide forecasts and choices made in the healthcare industry, assisting healthcare providers in allocating resources as efficiently as possible, strengthening their financial standing, and improving patient care.
