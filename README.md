# Healthcare Analysis using Python Code


* The code that is provided loads data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame and then does an extensive analysis of a healthcare dataset. It then moves on to data cleaning and investigation, revealing the contents of the DataFrame and pointing out any null values. Then, using a variety of visualisations, such as histograms, boxplots,scatterplots, and barplots, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is carried out to comprehend the distribution and correlations between various variables, including billing amounts, medical conditions, age, admission types, insurance providers, and room utilisation. Next, a financial impact analysis is performed, which includes total revenue calculation, identification of high-cost medical diseases and common insurance providers, and trend analysis of billing amounts. In statistical analysis, correlations are computed, linear regression is carried out to model  the factors impacting billing amounts, and regression coefficients are assessed. In order to assess the linear regression model's predictive ability, measurements such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE),  Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) are used. All things considered, this code thoroughly examines  and evaluates the healthcare dataset, offering insightful information about the variables influencing billing amounts in a healthcare setting.
